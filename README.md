<h1>CitizenCare</h1>

This is the project done by Group-9 for the Sem-2 course "Software Engineering".
CitizenCare sounds like a promising project! It seems to be aimed at improving citizen services or engagement. Using a combination of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, MongoDB, React.js, and Node.js suggests a comprehensive approach, covering both front-end and back-end development.

With MongoDB Atlas for the database, React.js for the front-end, and Node.js for the back-end, the project likely benefits from a modern, scalable architecture. React.js can provide a dynamic and responsive user interface, while Node.js enables efficient handling of server-side operations. MongoDB, being a NoSQL database, offers flexibility and scalability, which could be advantageous depending on the nature of the application's data.

The project can be downloaded, installed, and run locally on your personal laptop following the below methods:

1. Download the project in zip file or clone the repository in your computer.
2. In the root folder, run the command npm install so as to install all dependencies for the computer locally.

After successfully install dependencies, you can run the code directly locally via the command npm start  in the both Backend and my-app folder which will run a developement server on your local pc.
